          Originally domesticated in South America about 5,000 years ago, cacao trees can now be found in equatorial regions around the world. The beans from these trees are harvested to make both cocoa powder and its lesser-known counterpart, cacao powder.

          Cacao beans develop flavor and texture through a fermentation process before heading for processing into either cacao or cocoa powder. To create cocoa powder, processors apply very high temperatures to the cacao beans, which produces that smooth, sweet taste that people enjoy in baked goods or hot cocoa. Cocoa powder is less bitter than cacao, but it loses some of its nutritional value during processing.

          Cacao beans destined to become cacao powder and cacao nibs aren‚Äôt roasted at these high temperatures. Instead, they‚Äôre processed at low temperatures and then milled into a powder. Cacao powder is quite bitter, but retains more of the bean‚Äôs original nutritional value.

          Cacao powder can be a healthier alternative for recipes that call for cocoa powder.



          USES

           The fiber in cacao powder promotes healthy digestion and can reduce the risk and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and other digestive problems.

           Here are some other health benefits of cacao powder:

           Lower Blood Pressure

           Cacao powder is packed with flavonoids. These nutrients that have been shown to help lower blood pressure, improve blood flow to the brain and heart, and aid in preventing blood clots.

           Reduced Diabetes Risk

           The flavonoids in cacao powder may help increase insulin sensitivity, reducing your risk of diabetes.

           Reduced Heart Disease Risk

           Cacao powder contains lots of potassium. Potassium has been shown to decrease risk of heart disease by reducing lower body inflammation and stress on cells.

           Reduced Inflammation

           The flavonoids in cacao powder can help to reduce inflammation throughout your body. Reduced inflammation may lessen your risk of some cancers, diabetes, arthritis, depression, and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.

          NUTRIENTS

          Unlike many chocolate products, cacao nibs are naturally low in sugar. They‚Äôre also a good source of fiber, protein, and healthy fats ‚Äî nutrients that help promote feelings of fullness (2Trusted Source).

          They‚Äôre rich in many minerals, including iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, manganese, and copper. Magnesium is a mineral needed for over 300 different enzyme reactions in your body but lacking in many people‚Äôs diets (3Trusted Source).

          Phosphorus, magnesium, and manganese are vital for healthy bones, while copper and iron are needed for producing red blood cells that supply oxygen to your body (4Trusted Source).

          Additionally, cacao nibs are packed with potent plant compounds, including flavonoid antioxidants, which have been associated with numerous health benefits (5Trusted Source).

          The lemon, Citrus limon, is a species of small evergreen tree in the flowering plant family Rutaceae, native to South Asia, primarily North eastern India. Its fruits are round in shape.

          The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit is used for culinary and non-culinary purposes throughout the world, primarily for its juice, which has both culinary and cleaning uses. The pulp and rind are also used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5% to 6% citric acid, with a pH of around 2.2, giving it a sour taste. The distinctive sour taste of lemon juice makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie.
            
          Since ancient times, honey has been used as both a food and a medicine.

          It‚Äôs very high in beneficial plant compounds and offers several health benefits. Honey is particularly healthy when used instead of refined sugar, which is 100% empty calories.
          

          Honey is a sweet, thick liquid made by honeybees.

          The bees collect sugar ‚Äî mainly the sugar-rich nectar of flowers ‚Äî from their environment (1).

          Once inside the beehive, they repeatedly consume, digest and regurgitate the nectar.

          The end product is honey, a liquid that serves as stored food for bees. The smell, color and taste depend on the types of flowers visited.

          USES

          Raw honey contains an array of plant chemicals that act as antioxidants. Some types of honey have as many antioxidants as fruits and vegetables. Antioxidants help to protect your body from cell damage due to free radicals

          Free radicals contribute to the aging process and may also contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Research shows that antioxidant compounds in honey called polyphenols may play a role in preventing heart disease.

           honey is used in medical settings to treat wounds because it‚Äôs been found to be an effective germ killer and also aids in tissue regeneration.

          Studies show that honey can boost healing time and reduce infection. Keep in mind that the honey used in hospital settings is medical grade, meaning it‚Äôs inspected and sterile. It‚Äôs not a good idea to treat cuts with honey you buy from a store.

          
          Have a cold? Try a spoonful of honey. Honey is an old sore throat remedy. Add it to hot tea with lemon when a cold virus hits you.

          It also works as a cough suppressant. Research has suggested that honey is as effective as dextromethorphan, a common ingredient in over-the-counter cough medication. Just take one or two teaspoonfuls, straight.

          NUTRITION

          Some of the vitamins found in honey include ascorbic acid, pantothenic acid, niacin and riboflavin; along with minerals such as calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.

          For hundreds of years, people have used the roots and orange-red fruit of ashwagandha for medicinal purposes. The herb is also known as Indian ginseng or winter cherry.

          Ashwagandha is an important herb in Ayurvedic medicine. This is one of the world‚Äôs oldest medical systems and one of India‚Äôs healthcare systems.

          In Ayurvedic medicine, ashwagandha is considered a Rasayana. This means that it helps maintain youth, both mentally and physically.

          There is some evidence to suggest that the herb can have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Inflammation underpins many health conditions, and reducing inflammation can protect the body against a variety of conditions.

          
            WHAT ARE THE HEALTH BENEFITS ?

          Scientific studies have suggested that ashwagandha might be beneficial for a number of conditions.

          That said, researchers do not know a lot about how the herb reacts within the human body. Most studies so far have used animal or cell models, meaning that scientists do not know if the same results will occur in humans.

          There is some evidence to support the use of ashwagandha for the following:

          Stress and anxiety

          Ashwagandha may have a calming effect on anxiety symptoms when compared with the drug lorazepam, a sedative and anxiety medication.

          A 2000 study suggested that the herb had a comparable anxiety-reducing effect with lorazepam, suggesting that ashwagandha might be as effective for reducing anxiety. However, the researchers conducted this study in mice, not humans.

          In a 2019 study in humans, researchers found that taking a daily dose of 240 milligrams (mg) of ashwagandha significantly reduced people‚Äôs stress levels when compared with a placebo. This included reduced levels of cortisol, which is a stress hormone.

          In another 2019 study in humans, taking 250 mg or 600 mg of ashwagandha per day resulted in lower self-reported stress levels, as well as lower cortisol levels.

          Although this research is promising, scientists need to collect much more data before recommending the herb to treat anxiety.

          Arthritis

          Ashwagandha may act as a pain reliever, preventing pain signals from traveling along the central nervous system. It may also have some anti-inflammatory properties.

          For this reason, some research has shown it to be effective in treating forms of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis.

          A small 2015 study in 125 people with joint pain found the herb to have potential as a treatment option for rheumatoid arthritis.

          Heart health

          Some people use ashwagandha to boost their heart health, including:

          lowering high blood pressure
          lowering high cholesterol
          easing chest pain
          preventing heart disease
          However, there is little research to support these benefits.

          One 2015 study in humans suggested that ashwagandha root extract could enhance a person‚Äôs cardiorespiratory endurance, which could improve heart health. However, more research is necessary.

          Alzheimer‚Äôs treatment

          According to a 2011 review, several studies have examined ashwagandha‚Äôs ability to slow or prevent loss of brain function in people with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, Huntington‚Äôs disease, and Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

          As these conditions progress, parts of the brain and its connective paths become damaged, which leads to loss of memory and function. This review suggests that when mice and rats receive ashwagandha during the early disease stages, it may be able to offer protection.

          Cancer

          The same 2011 review also describes a few promising studies that found that ashwagandha might be able to stop cell growth in certain cancers. This includes reducing lung tumors in

          HOW TO TAKE ASHWAGANDHA

              The dosage of ashwagandha and the way people use it depends on the condition they are hoping to treat. There is no standard dosage based on modern clinical trials.

              Different studies have used different dosages. Some research suggests that taking 250‚Äì600 mg per day can reduce stress. Other studies have used much higher dosages.

              Capsule dosages often contain between 250 and 1,500 mg of ashwagandha. The herb comes in the form of a capsule, powder, and liquid extract.

              In some cases, taking high doses can cause unpleasant side effects. It is best to speak with a healthcare professional about safety and dosage before taking any new herbal supplements, including ashwagandha.

        1. SPIRULINA IS EXTREMELY HIGH IN MANY NUTRIENTS

        Spirulina is an organism that grows in both fresh and salt water.

        It is a type of cyanobacteria, which is a family of single-celled microbes that are often referred to as blue-green algae.

        Just like plants, cyanobacteria can produce energy from sunlight via a process called photosynthesis.

        Spirulina was consumed by the ancient Aztecs but became popular again when NASA proposed that it could be grown in space for use by astronauts (1).

        A standard daily dose of spirulina is 1‚Äì3 grams, but doses of up to 10 grams per day have been used effectively.

        This tiny alga is packed with nutrients. A single tablespoon (7 grams) of dried spirulina powder contains (2Trusted Source):

        Protein: 4 grams
        Vitamin B1 (thiamine): 11% of the RDA
        Vitamin B2 (riboflavin): 15% of the RDA
        Vitamin B3 (niacin): 4% of the RDA
        Copper: 21% of the RDA
        Iron: 11% of the RDA
        It also contains decent amounts of magnesium, potassium and manganese and small amounts of almost every other nutrient that you need.
        In addition, the same amount holds only 20 calories and 1.7 grams of digestible carbs.

        Gram for gram, spirulina may be the single most nutritious food on the planet.

        A tablespoon (7 grams) of spirulina provides a small amount of fat ‚Äî around 1 gram ‚Äî including both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in an approximately 1.5‚Äì1.0 ratio.

        The quality of the protein in spirulina is considered excellent ‚Äî comparable to eggs. It gives all the essential amino acids that you need.

        2. Powerful Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Properties
        Oxidative damage can harm your DNA and cells.

        This damage can drive chronic inflammation, which contributes to cancer and other diseases (5).

        Spirulina is a fantastic source of antioxidants, which can protect against oxidative damage.

        Its main active component is called phycocyanin. This antioxidant substance also gives spirulina its unique blue-green color.

        Phycocyanin can fight free radicals and inhibit production of inflammatory signaling molecules, providing impressive antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).

        3. Can Lower ‚ÄúBad‚Äù LDL and Triglyceride Levels

        Heart disease is the world‚Äôs leading cause of death.

        Many risk factors are linked to an increased risk of heart disease.

        As it turns out, spirulina positively impacts many of these factors. For example, it can lower total cholesterol, ‚Äúbad‚Äù LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, while raising ‚Äúgood‚Äù HDL cholesterol.

        In a study in 25 people with type 2 diabetes, 2 grams of spirulina per day significantly improved these markers (9Trusted Source).

        Another study in people with high cholesterol determined that 1 gram of spirulina per day lowered triglycerides by 16.3% and ‚Äúbad‚Äù LDL by 10.1% (10Trusted Source).

        Several other studies have found favorable effects ‚Äî though with higher doses of 4.5‚Äì8 grams per day (11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).

          The olive, known by the botanical name Olea europaea, meaning "European olive", is a species of small tree in the family Oleaceae, found traditionally in the Mediterranean Basin. The species is cultivated in all the countries of the Mediterranean, as well as South America, South Africa, India, China, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and the United States.[1][2] Olea europaea is the type species for the genus Olea.

          The olive's fruit, also called the olive, is of major agricultural importance in the Mediterranean region as the source of olive oil; it is one of the core ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine. The tree and its fruit give their name to the plant family, which also includes species such as lilacs, jasmine, Forsythia, and the true ash trees

          DESCRIPTION
          
          The olive tree, Olea europaea, is an evergreen tree or shrub native to Mediterranean Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is short and squat, and rarely exceeds 8‚Äì15 m (26‚Äì49 ft) in height. 'Pisciottana', a unique variety comprising 40,000 trees found only in the area around Pisciotta in the Campania region of southern Italy often exceeds this, with correspondingly large trunk diameters. The silvery green leaves are oblong, measuring 4‚Äì10 cm (1.6‚Äì3.9 in) long and 1‚Äì3 cm (0.39‚Äì1.18 in) wide. The trunk is typically gnarled and twisted.[10]

          The small, white, feathery flowers, with ten-cleft calyx and corolla, two stamens, and bifid stigma, are borne generally on the previous year's wood, in racemes springing from the axils of the leaves.

          The fruit is a small drupe 1‚Äì2.5 cm (0.39‚Äì0.98 in) long when ripe, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars. Olives are harvested in the green to purple stage.[11] Canned black olives have often been artificially blackened[12] (see below on processing) and may contain the chemical ferrous gluconate to improve the appearance.[13] Olea europaea contains a seed commonly referred to in American English as a pit, and in British English as a stone

          CULTIVATION

           Hundreds of cultivars of the olive tree are known. An olive's cultivar has a significant impact on its colour, size, shape, and growth characteristics, as well as the qualities of olive oil. Olive cultivars may be used primarily for oil, eating, or both. Olives cultivated for consumption are generally referred to as table olives.

           Since many olive cultivars are self-sterile or nearly so, they are generally planted in pairs with a single primary cultivar and a secondary cultivar selected for its ability to fertilize the primary one. In recent times, efforts have been directed at producing hybrid cultivars with qualities useful to farmers, such as resistance to disease, quick growth, and larger or more consistent crops.

          Neem is a tree. The bark, leaves, and seeds are used to make medicine. Less frequently, the root, flower, and fruit are also used.

          Neem leaf is used for leprosy, eye disorders, bloody nose, intestinal worms, stomach upset, loss of appetite, skin ulcers, diseases of the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease), fever, diabetes, gum disease (gingivitis), and liver problems. The leaf is also used for birth control and to cause abortions.

          The bark is used for malaria, stomach and intestinal ulcers, skin diseases, pain, and fever.

          The flower is used for reducing bile, controlling phlegm, and treating intestinal worms.

          The fruit is used for hemorrhoids, intestinal worms, urinary tract disorders, bloody nose, phlegm, eye disorders, diabetes, wounds, and leprosy.

          Neem twigs are used for cough, asthma, hemorrhoids, intestinal worms, low sperm levels, urinary disorders, and diabetes. People in the tropics sometimes chew neem twigs instead of using toothbrushes, but this can cause illness; neem twigs are often contaminated with fungi within 2 weeks of harvest and should be avoided.

          The seed and seed oil are used for leprosy and intestinal worms. They are also used for birth control and to cause abortions.

          The stem, root bark, and fruit are used as a tonic and astringent.

          Some people apply neem directly to the skin to treat head lice, skin diseases, wounds, and skin ulcers; as a mosquito repellent; and as a skin softener.

          Inside the vagina, neem is used for birth control.
          
           Neem is also used as an insecticide.

           As a vegetable[edit]
           The tender shoots and flowers of the neem tree are eaten as a vegetable in India. A souplike dish called Veppampoo charu (Tamil) (translated as "neem flower rasam") made of the flower of neem is prepared in Tamil Nadu. In Bengal, young neem leaves are fried in oil with tiny pieces of eggplant (brinjal). The dish is called neem begun bhaja and is the first item during a Bengali meal that acts as an appetizer. It is eaten with rice.[12]

           Neem is used in parts of mainland Southeast Asia, particularly in Cambodia aka sdov‚Äî·ûü·üí·ûä·üÖ·ûú,[13] Laos (where it is called kadao), Thailand (where it is known as sa-dao (‡∏™‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏î‡∏≤) or sdao), Myanmar (where it is known as tamar) and Vietnam (where it is known as s·∫ßu ƒë√¢u and is used to cook the salad g·ªèi s·∫ßu ƒë√¢u). Even if lightly cooked, the flavour is quite bitter and the food is not enjoyed by all inhabitants of these nations, though it is believed to be good for one's health. Neem gum is a rich source of protein. In Myanmar, young neem leaves and flower buds are boiled with tamarind fruit to soften its bitterness and eaten as a vegetable. Pickled neem leaves are also eaten with tomato and fish paste sauce in Myanmar.

           Traditional medicinal use[edit]
           Products made from neem trees have been used in the traditional medicine of India for centuries.[11][14] Insufficient research has been done to assess such purported benefits of neem.[14][15] In adults, no specific doses have been established, and short-term use of neem appears to be safe, while long-term use may harm the kidneys or liver; in small children, neem oil is toxic and can lead to death.[15] Neem may also cause miscarriages, infertility, and low blood sugar.[15] There is no high-quality clinical evidence to indicate use of neem for any medical purpose.[14]

           Pest and disease control[edit]
           Neem is a key ingredient in non-pesticidal management (NPM), providing a natural alternative to synthetic pesticides. Neem seeds are ground into powder that is soaked overnight in water and sprayed onto the crop. To be effective, it must be applied repeatedly, at least every ten days. Neem does not directly kill insects on the crop. It acts as an anti-feedant, repellent, and egg-laying deterrent and thus protect the crop from damage. The insects starve and die within a few days. Neem also suppresses the hatching of pest insects from their eggs. Neem-based fertilizeres have been effective against the pest southern armyworm. Neem cake is often sold as a fertilizer.[16]

           Neem oil has been shown to avert termite attack as an ecofriendly and economical agent.[17]

           Neem oil for polymeric resins[edit]
           Applications of neem oil in the preparation of polymeric resins have been documented in the recent reports. The synthesis of various alkyd resins from neem oil is reported using a monoglyceride (MG) route and their utilization for the preparation of PU coatings.[18] The alkyds are prepared from reaction of conventional divalent acid materials like phthalic and maleic anhydrides with MG of neem oil.

          Shilajit is a sticky substance found primarily in the rocks of the Himalayas. It develops over centuries from the slow decomposition of plants.

          Shilajit is commonly used in ayurvedic medicine. It‚Äôs an effective and safe supplement that can have a positive effect on your overall health and well-being.


          BENEFITS
          
          1. Alzheimer‚Äôs disease

          Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is a progressive brain disorder that causes problems with memory, behavior, and thinking. Drug treatments are available to improve symptoms of Alzheimer‚Äôs. But based on the molecular composition of shilajit, some researchers believe shilajit may prevent or slowTrusted Source the progression of Alzheimer‚Äôs.

          The primary component of shilajit is an antioxidant known as fulvic acid. This powerful antioxidant contributes to cognitive health by preventing the accumulation of tau protein. Tau proteins are an important part of your nervous system, but a buildup can trigger brain cell damage.

          Researchers think that the fulvic acid in shilajit may stop the abnormal buildup of tau protein and reduce inflammation, potentially improving Alzheimer‚Äôs symptoms. However, more research and clinical trials are needed.

          2. Low testosterone level

          Testosterone is a primary male sex hormone, but some men have a lower level than others. Signs of low testosterone include:

          a low sex drive
          hair loss
          loss of muscle mass
          fatigue
          increased body fat
          In one clinical studyTrusted Source of male volunteers between the ages of 45 and 55, half of the participants were given a placebo and half were given a 250 milligram (mg) dose of purified shilajit twice a day. After 90 consecutive days, the study found that participants receiving purified shilajit had a significantly higher testosterone level compared to the placebo group.

          3. Chronic fatigue syndrome

          Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a long-term condition that causes extreme tiredness or fatigue. CFS can make it difficult to go to work or school, and simple everyday activities can prove challenging. Researchers think that shilajit supplements may reduce symptoms of CFS and restore energy.

          CFS has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. This occurs when your cells don‚Äôt produce enough energy. In a study from 2012, researchers gave lab rats shilajit for 21 days, and then induced CFS by forcing the rats to swim 15 minutes for 21 consecutive days. The results found that shilajit helped reduce the effects of CFS. They think this was the result of the shilajit helping to prevent mitochondrial dysfunction.

          Based on these results, naturally boosting your body‚Äôs mitochondrial function with shilajit supplements may help improve energy levels.

          4. Aging

          Since shilajit is rich in fulvic acid, a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, it may also protect against free radicals and cellular damage. As a result, regular use of shilajit may contributeTrusted Source to longevity, a slower aging process, and overall better health.

          5. High altitude sickness

          A higher altitude can trigger a range of symptoms, including:

          pulmonary edema
          insomnia
          lethargy, or feeling tired or sluggish
          body pain
          dementia
          hypoxia
          Altitude sickness can be triggered by low atmospheric pressure, cold temperatures, or high wind velocity. Researchers think that shilajit may help you overcome high altitude problems.

          Shilajit contains fulvic acid and more than 84 mineralsTrusted Source, so it offers numerous health benefits. It can function as an antioxidant to improve your body‚Äôs immunity and memory, an anti-inflammatory, an energy booster, and a diuretic to remove excess fluid from your body. Because of these benefits, shilajit is thought to help counteract many symptoms associated with higher altitudes.

          6. Iron deficiency anemia

          Iron deficiency anemia can result from a low-iron diet, blood loss, or an inability to absorb iron. Symptoms include:

          fatigue
          weakness
          cold hands and feet
          headache
          irregular heartbeat
          Shilajit supplements, however, may gradually increase iron levels.

          A study divided 18 rats into three groups of six. Researchers induced anemia in the second and third group. Rats in the third group received 500 mg of shilajit after 11 days. Researchers collected blood samples from all groups on day 21. The results revealed that rats in the third group had higher levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cells compared to rats in the second group. These are all vital components of your blood.

          7. Infertility

          Shilajit is also a safe supplement for male infertility. In one studyTrusted Source, a group of 60 infertile men took shilajit twice a day for 90 days after meals. At the end of the 90-day period, more than 60 percent of the study participants showed an increase in total sperm count. More than 12 percent had an increase in sperm motility. Sperm motility refers to the ability of the sperm in a sample to move adequately, an important part of fertility.

          8. Heart health

          Shilajit as a dietary supplement may also improve heart health. Researchers tested the cardiac performance of shilajit on lab rats. After receiving a pretreatment of shilajit, some rats were injected with isoproterenol to induce heart injury. The study found that rats given shilajit prior to cardiac injury had fewer cardiac lesions.

          You shouldn‚Äôt take shilajit if you have active heart disease.

          HOW TO USE IT

          Shilajit is available in liquid and powder forms. Always administer supplements according to instructions. If you buy the supplement in liquid form, dissolve a portion the size of a grain of rice or a pea size in liquid and drink one to three times a day (depending on instructions). Or you can take shilajit powder twice a day with milk. The recommended dose of shilajit is 300 to 500 mg per dayTrusted Source. Speak with your doctor before taking shilajit.

You can sprinkle these bee grains over breakfast bowls, dessert or dinner. It‚Äôs extremely rich in carotenes and high in B-complex, vitamins and Lecithin.

          DESCRIPTION

          The Bee Pollen used in this product is 100% natural and may vary in colour and flavour depending upon the season of harvest of the Bee Pollen.

          It contains vitamin A, C, D, E, K and all the B‚Äôs plus amino acids, omega 3 oils, folic acid and antioxidants carotenes and in B-complex and Lecuthin. You can chew these bee grains or sprinkle over breakfast bowls, dessert or dinner or add to a smoothie.

          Ingredients: 100% dried bee pollen granules.

          Usage: if you are a beginner introduce bee pollen gradually into your diet. Start with 1-2 granules a day and increase to 1 tablespoon.

          

          Bee pollen is not recommended for children under 2 years old and for those with allergies to pollen, pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.  Check with your doctor before taking bee pollen if you are taking any medication.

          Store in an air tight container in a cool, dark place or keep it refrigerated.

          What the research says
          In recent years, a number of scientists have published studies on the supposed health benefits of bee pollen. However, these studies are mostly on animals and have yet to be proven on humans.

          Here‚Äôs what the research says about bee pollen benefits:

          Relieving inflammation

          Bee pollen may work similarly to anti-inflammatory drugs, according to researchers. In one studyTrusted Source on rats, scientists found that bee pollen extract reduced inflammation in rats with swollen paws. ResearchTrusted Source on mice showed bee pollen had anti-inflammatory effects when used to treat their liver disease.

          Working as an antioxidant

          ResearchersTrusted Source have found that bee pollen has very high antioxidant properties similar to those of fermented foods. Antioxidants are naturally occurring chemicals that exist in plant-based foods, usually those that are red or dark in color, as well as fermented foods.

          Some common antioxidants include:

          flavenols (found in chocolate)
          resveratrol (found in wine)
          lycopene (found in tomatoes)
          Antioxidants keep people healthy by counteracting oxidants such as air pollution and cigarette smoke that can damage the body.

          Boosting liver health

          The liver is responsible for filtering toxins out of the body. ResearchersTrusted Source found that in rats, bee pollen helps keep the liver healthy and can even help the healing process after liver damage.

          Researchers noted that the rats had no side effects in taking bee pollen, compared to silibinin, a medication that also contains antioxidants but can also cause harm.

          Strengthening the immune system

          A strong immune system is necessary for fighting off disease and keeping you healthy. One studyTrusted Source found that bee pollen naturally inhibits allergic reactions in mice. Another studyTrusted Source suggests that bee pollen has antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. These properties could help kill off bacteria and viruses, such as staphylococcus aureus, which causes food poisoning.

          Working as a dietary supplement

          Bee pollen could potentially work as a supplement that helps your diet and health. One studyTrusted Source looked at rabbits that received a bee pollen supplement in addition to their regular diet. They had a longer lifespan and also greater reproductive success. They gave birth to healthier, stronger babies compared to rabbits who didn‚Äôt take the supplement.

          Another studyTrusted Source found that malnourished, old rats experienced improved muscle mass and metabolism after eating a diet that contained bee pollen.

          Easing symptoms of menopause

          Many women who take antihormonal medications often experience symptoms of menopause. One studyTrusted Source found that some women with breast cancer who took a bee pollen supplement experienced fewer, less intense menopause symptoms than those who didn‚Äôt.

          Reducing stress

          Bee pollen can increase blood flow to the body‚Äôs nervous system, helping reduce stress. It‚Äôs also effective for tiredness, according to a review of bee pollenTrusted Source.

          Speeding healing

          ResearchTrusted Source shows that bee pollen can be used on the skin to speed healing, as it boosts blood circulation, kills bacteria, and moistens the skin.

          Chia seeds are the tiny black seeds of the chia plant (Salvia hispanica).

          Native to Mexico and Guatemala, they were a staple food for the ancient Aztecs and Mayans. In fact, ‚Äúchia‚Äù is the ancient Mayan word for ‚Äústrength‚Äù (1).

          Chia seeds contain large amounts of fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, plenty of high-quality protein, and several essential minerals and antioxidants.

          They may improve digestive health, blood levels of heart-healthy omega-3s, and risk factors for heart disease and diabetes.

          Chia seeds are small, flat, and ovular with a shiny and smooth texture. Their color ranges from white to brown or black (2).

          These seeds are highly versatile. They can be soaked and added to porridge, made into pudding, used in baked goods, or simply sprinkled on top of salads or yogurt.

          Because of their ability to absorb liquid and form a gel, they can also be used to thicken sauces or as an egg replacement (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).

          DESCRIPTION

          Another area in which chia seeds shine is their high antioxidant content (2Trusted Source, 3).

          These antioxidants protect the sensitive fats in the seeds from going rancid (4).

          Though the benefits of antioxidant supplements are debated, researchers agree that getting antioxidants from foods can have positive health effects (5Trusted Source).

          Most importantly, antioxidants fight the production of free radicals, which can damage cell molecules and contribute to aging and diseases like cancer (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).


          One ounce (28 grams) of chia seeds has 12 grams of carbs. However, 11 of those grams are fiber, which your body doesn‚Äôt digest.

          Fiber neither raises blood sugar nor requires insulin to be disposed of. Though it belongs to the carbohydrate family, its health effects are drastically different from those of digestible carbs like starch and sugar.

          The digestible carb content is only one gram per ounce (28 grams), which is very low. This makes chia a low-carb friendly food.

          Because of its high soluble fiber content, chia seeds can absorb up to 10‚Äì12 times their weight in water, becoming gel-like and expanding in your stomach (8).

          Theoretically, this should increase fullness, slow absorption of your food and help you automatically eat fewer calories.

          Fiber also feeds the friendly bacteria in your intestine, which is important ‚Äî keeping your gut flora well fed is absolutely crucial for health (9Trusted Source).

          Chia seeds are 40% fiber by weight, making them one of the best sources of fiber in the world.

          SUMMARY
          Almost all of the carbohydrates in chia seeds are fiber. This gives them the ability to absorb 10‚Äì12 times their weight in water. Fiber also has various beneficial effects on health.
          4. Chia Seeds Are High in Quality Protein
          Chia seeds contain a decent amount of protein.

          By weight, they‚Äôre about 14% protein, which is very high compared to most plants.

          They also have a good balance of essential amino acids, so your body should be able to make use of their protein content (10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source).

          Protein has various health benefits and is by far the most weight loss friendly dietary nutrient.

          A high protein intake lowers appetite and has been shown to reduce obsessive thoughts about food by 60% and the desire for night time snacking by 50% (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).

          Chia seeds really are an excellent protein source ‚Äî especially for people who eat little or no animal products.

          USES

          Chia seeds are incredibly easy to incorporate into your diet.

          The seeds themselves taste rather bland, so you can add them to pretty much anything.

          They also don‚Äôt need to be ground like flax seeds, which makes them much easier to prepare.

          They can be eaten raw, soaked in juice, added to porridge, pudding, smoothies or added to baked goods.

          You can also sprinkle them on top of cereal, yogurt, vegetables or rice dishes.

          Because of their ability to absorb both water and fat, they can be used to thicken sauces and as egg substitutes in recipes.

          They can also be mixed with water and turned into a gel.

          Adding chia seeds to recipes will dramatically boost their nutritional value.

          If you want to buy chia seeds, there is an excellent selection on Amazon with thousands of customer reviews.

          They do also seem to be well tolerated, but if you‚Äôre not used to eating a lot of fiber, then there is a possibility of digestive side effects if you eat too much at a time.

          A common dosage recommendation is 20 grams (about 1.5 tablespoons) of chia seeds, twice per day.

          Propolis is a sticky but miraculous bee product with many healing properties. Raw Propolis is a substance that the bees make using tree buds.  Propolis was well known to the ancient Greeks as a cure for dental abscesses, infections, colds, and flu and as a general natural antibiotic. Use propolis to treat various types of wounds, burns, bedsores, ulcers external surgical wounds.

          The use of Propolis healing is very wide since it has an antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, anti-inflammatory effect. Since ancient times in folk medicine use raw propolis. Propolis poorly soluble in water, so most often be the subject of alcohol or oil solution. Cosmetics and medicine from propolis are preparing for a variety of medicinal ointments, lotions, creams ‚Äì burn healing, reducing inflammation of the skin and so on.

          Propolis is collected in much the same way as pollen and packed into small baskets on the bee‚Äôs hind legs. However, because of its sticky nature, they must get help from neighboring bees to remove it. Its most famous role, however, is as an antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal coating to the hive.

          Raw Propolis is a substance that the bees make using tree buds.

          Bees, by pollinating trees and crops, are true sustainers of life on earth. Without their tireless service, we simply would not be able to feed ourselves. At the same time, they also create a wide variety of other useful products.

          COMPOSTITION

          The composition of propolis varies from hive to hive, from district to district, and from season to season.[7] Normally, it is dark brown in color, but it can be found in green, red, black, and white hues, depending on the sources of resin found in the particular hive area. Honey bees are opportunists, gathering what they need from available sources, and detailed analyses show that the chemical composition of propolis varies considerably from region to region, along with the vegetation. In northern temperate climates, for example, bees collect resins from trees, such as poplars and conifers (the biological role of resin in trees is to seal wounds and defend against bacteria, fungi, and insects). "Typical" northern temperate propolis has approximately 50 constituents, primarily resins and vegetable balsams (50%), waxes (30%), essential oils (10%), and pollen (5%). Propolis also contains persistent lipophilic acaricides, a natural pesticide that deters mite infestations.[8]

          In neotropical regions, in addition to a large variety of trees, bees may also gather resin from flowers in the genera Clusia and Dalechampia, which are the only known plant genera that produce floral resins to attract pollinators.[9] Clusia resin contains polyprenylated benzophenones.[10][11][12] In some areas of Chile and Argentina Andean valleys, propolis contains viscidone, a terpene from Baccharis shrubs,[13] and in Brazil and Paraguay, naphthoquinone epoxide has recently been isolated from red propolis,[14] and prenylated acids such as 4-hydroxy-3,5-diprenyl cinnamic acid have been documented.[15] An analysis of propolis from Henan, China found sinapinic acid, isoferulic acid, caffeic acid, and chrysin, with the first three compounds demonstrating antibacterial properties.[16] Also, Brazilian red propolis, largely derived from Dalbergia ecastaphyllum plant resin, has high relative percentages of the isoflavonoids 3-hydroxy-8,9-dimethoxypterocarpan and medicarpin.[17] Other flavonoids commonly present include galangin and pinocembrin.[18] Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is also a component of some varieties of propolis from New Zealand.[19]

          Occasionally, worker bees will even gather various caulking compounds of human manufacture, when the usual sources are more difficult to obtain.[citation needed] The properties of the propolis depend on the exact sources used by each individual hive; therefore any potential medicinal properties that may be present in one hive's propolis may be absent from another's, or from another sample in the same hive.

            WHAT THE RESEARCH SAYS

          Propolis is thought to have antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. But scientific research on propolis is limited. Researchers aren‚Äôt exactly sure why, but the bee product appears to provide protection from some bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

          Wounds

          Propolis has a special compound called pinocembrin, a flavonoid that acts as an antifungal. These anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties make propolis helpful in wound healing. One study found that propolis can help people who have had traumatic burns heal faster by speeding up new healthy cell growth.

          Another studyTrusted Source found that a topical propolis alcoholic extract was more effective than a steroid cream in reducing mast cells in oral surgery wounds. Mast cells are associated with inflammation and slowed wound healing.

          Cold sores and genital herpes

          Ointments that contain 3 percent propolis, such as Herstat or Coldsore-FX, may help speed healing time and reduce symptoms in both cold sores and sores from genital herpes.

          One studyTrusted Source found when topical propolis was applied three times a day, it helped to heal cold sores faster than no treatment. The researchers found the propolis cream not only reduced the amount of herpes virus present in a person‚Äôs body, but also protected the body against future cold sore breakouts.

          Cancer

          Propolis has been suggested to have a role in treating certain cancers as well. According to one studyTrusted Source, some of the anti-cancerous effects of the substance include:

          keeping cancerous cells from multiplying
          reducing the likelihood cells will become cancerous
          blocking pathways that keep cancer cells from signaling to each other
          The study also suggested that propolis could be a complementary therapy ‚Äî but not a sole treatment ‚Äî for cancer. Another study found that taking Chinese propolis could be a helpful complementary therapy in treating breast cancer due to its anti-tumor effects on breast cancer cells.

          Fossil records show that the date palm has existed for at least 50 million years.


          Dried date, peach, and apricot from Lahun, Fayum, Egypt. Late Middle Kingdom.
          Dates have been a staple food of the Middle East and the Indus Valley for thousands of years. They are believed to have originated around what is now Iraq. There is archaeological evidence of date cultivation in Mehrgarh around 7000 BCE, a Neolithic civilization in what is now western Pakistan,[15] and in eastern Arabia between 5530 and 5320 calBC. and have been cultivated since ancient times from Mesopotamia to prehistoric Egypt. The ancient Egyptians used the fruits to make date wine, and ate them at harvest.[citation needed] Evidence of cultivation is continually found throughout later civilizations in the Indus Valley, including the Harappan period of 2600 to 1900 BCE. The ancient Hebrews made the fruit into wine, vinegar, bread, and cakes, also using the fruit stones to fatten livestock and the wood to make utensils

          Dates provide various antioxidants that have a number of health benefits to offer, including a reduced risk of several diseases.

          Antioxidants protect your cells from free radicals, which are unstable molecules that may cause harmful reactions in your body and lead to disease.

          Compared to similar types of fruit, such as figs and dried plums, dates appear to have the highest antioxidant content (8Trusted Source).

          Here‚Äôs an overview of the three most potent antioxidants in dates:

          Flavonoids: Flavonoids are powerful antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation and have been studied for their potential to reduce the risk of diabetes, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and certain types of cancer (2Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).
          Carotenoids: Carotenoids are proven to promote heart health and may also reduce the risk of eye-related disorders, such as macular degeneration (2Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).
          Phenolic acid: Known for its anti-inflammatory properties, phenolic acid may help lower the risk of cancer and heart disease .

          HISTORY

          Turmeric has been used in Asia for centuries and is a major part of Ayurveda, Siddha medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, Unani, and the animistic rituals of Austronesian peoples. It was first used as a dye, and then later for its supposed properties in folk medicine.

          From India, it spread to Southeast Asia along with Hinduism and Buddhism, as the yellow dye is used to color the robes of monks and priests. Turmeric has also been found in Tahiti, Hawaii and Easter Island before European contact.[15] There is linguistic and circumstantial evidence of the spread and use of turmeric by the Austronesian peoples into Oceania and Madagascar. The populations in Polynesia and Micronesia, in particular, never came into contact with India, but use turmeric widely for both food and dye. Thus independent domestication events are also likely.

          Turmeric was found in Farmana, dating to between 2600 and 2200 BCE, and in a merchant's tomb in Megiddo, Israel dating from the second millennium BCE.[16] It was noted as a dye plant in the Assyrians Cuneiform medical texts from Ashurbanipal‚Äôs library at Nineveh from 7th century BCE. In Medieval Europe, turmeric was called "Indian saffron

            BENEFITS

            Recently, science has started to back up what Indians have known for a long time ‚Äî it really does contain compounds with medicinal properties .

            These compounds are called curcuminoids, the most important of which is curcumin.

            Curcumin is the main active ingredient in turmeric. It has powerful anti-inflammatory effects and is a very strong antioxidant.

            However, the curcumin content of turmeric is not that high. It‚Äôs around 3%, by weight .

            Most of the studies on this herb are using turmeric extracts that contain mostly curcumin itself, with dosages usually exceeding 1 gram per day.

            It would be very difficult to reach these levels just using the turmeric spice in your foods.

            Therefore, if you want to experience the full effects, you need to take a supplement that contains significant amounts of curcumin.

            Unfortunately, curcumin is poorly absorbed into the bloodstream. It helps to consume black pepper with it, which contains piperine, a natural substance that enhances the absorption of curcumin by 2,000% .

            The best curcumin supplements contain piperine, substantially increasing their effectiveness.

            Curcumin is also fat soluble, so it may be a good idea to take it with a fatty meal.

            Cancer is a terrible disease, characterized by uncontrolled cell growth.

            There are many different forms of cancer, which still have several things in common. Some of them appear to be affected by curcumin supplements (33Trusted Source).

            Curcumin has been studied as a beneficial herb in cancer treatment and been found to affect cancer growth, development and spread at the molecular level .

            Studies have shown that it can contribute to the death of cancerous cells and reduce angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels in tumors) and metastasis (spread of cancer) (35Trusted Source).

            Multiple studies indicate that curcumin can reduce the growth of cancerous cells in the laboratory and inhibit the growth of tumors in test animals .

            Whether high-dose curcumin (preferably with an absorption enhancer like piperine) can help treat cancer in humans has yet to be studied properly.

            However, there is evidence that it may prevent cancer from occurring in the first place, especially cancers of the digestive system like colorectal cancer.

            In a 30-day study in 44 men with lesions in the colon that sometimes turn cancerous, 4 grams of curcumin per day reduced the number of lesions by 40% .

            Maybe curcumin will be used along with conventional cancer treatment one day. It‚Äôs too early to say for sure, but it looks promising and is being intensively studie
